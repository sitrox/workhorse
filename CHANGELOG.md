# Workhorse Changelog

## 0.6.4 - 2019-10-12

* Fix #22 where an exception with message `No live threads left. Deadlock?`
  could be thrown in the worker processes.

## 0.6.3 - 2019-09-02

* Fix examples in changelog, readme and generator for starting workers. Some of
  the examples were non-functional after the changes introduced by 0.6.0.

## 0.6.2 - 2019-07-10

* Make compatible with older ruby versions.

## 0.6.1 - 2019-07-09

* Allow calling `Workhorse.setup` multiple times.

## 0.6.0 - 2019-07-03

* Adapt {Workhorse::Daemon} to support a specific block for each worker. This
  allows, for example, to run a scheduler like Rufus in a separate worker
  process.

  If you're using the daemon class, you will need to restructure your workhorse
  starting script.

  Since there is no `count` attribute anymore, transfer this:

  ```ruby
  Workhorse::Daemon::ShellHandler.run count: 5 do
    Workhorse::Worker.start_and_wait(pool_size: 1, logger: Rails.logger)
  end
  ```

  into this:

  ```ruby
  Workhorse::Daemon::ShellHandler.run do |daemon|
    5.times do
      daemon.worker do
        Workhorse::Worker.start_and_wait(pool_size: 1, logger: Rails.logger)
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  See readme for more information.
