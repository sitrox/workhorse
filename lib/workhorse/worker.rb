    # @param queues [Array] The queues you want this worker to process. If an
    #   empty array is given, any queues will be processed. Queues need to be
    #   specified as a symbol. To also process jobs without a queue, supply
    #   `nil` within the array.
    # @param pool_size [Integer] The number of jobs that will be processed
    #   simultaneously. If this parameter is not given, it will be set to the
    #   number of given queues + 1.
    # @param polling_interval [Integer] Interval in seconds the database will
    #   be polled for new jobs. Set this as high as possible to avoid
    #   unnecessary database load. Defaults to 5 minutes.
    # @param auto_terminate [Boolean] Whether to automatically shut down the
    #   worker properly on INT and TERM signals.
    # @param quiet [Boolean] If this is set to `false`, the worker will also log
    #   to STDOUT.
    # @param logger [Logger] An optional logger the worker will append to. This
    #   can be any instance of ruby's `Logger` but is commonly set to
    #   `Rails.logger`.
