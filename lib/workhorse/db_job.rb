    # set by workhorse in course of processing this job.
    #
    # This is only allowed if the job is in a final state ("succeeded" or
    # "failed"), as only those jobs are safe to modify; workhorse will not touch
    # these jobs. To reset a job without checking the state it is in, set
    # "force" to true. Prior to doing so, ensure that the job is not still being
    # processed by a worker. If possible, shut down all workers before
    # performing a forced reset.
    #
    # After the job is reset, it will be performed again. If you reset a job
    # that has already been performed ("succeeded") or partially performed
    # ("failed"), make sure the actions performed in the job are repeatable or
    # have been rolled back. E.g. if the job already wrote something to an
    # external API, it may cause inconsistencies if the job is performed again.
