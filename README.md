# Workhorse

Multi-threaded job backend with database queuing for ruby. Battle-tested and ready for production-use.

## Introduction

How it works:

* Jobs are instances of classes that support the `perform` method.
* Jobs are persisted in the database using ActiveRecord.
* Each job has a priority, the default being 0. Jobs with higher priorities
  (lower is higher, 0 the highest) get processed first.
* Each job can be set to execute after a certain date / time.
* You can start one or more worker processes.
* Each worker is configurable as to which queue(s) it processes. Jobs in the
  same queue never run simultaneously. Jobs with no queue can always run in
  parallel.
* Each worker polls the database and spawns a configurable number of threads to
  execute jobs of different queues simultaneously.

What it does not do:

* It does not spawn new processes on the fly. Jobs are run in separate threads
  but not in separate processes (unless you manually start multiple worker
  processes).
* It does not support
  [timeouts](FAQ.md#why-does-workhorse-not-support-timeouts).

## Installation

### Requirements

* Ruby `>= 2.0.0`
* Rails `>= 3.2`
* A database and table handler that properly supports row-level locking (such as
  MySQL with InnoDB, PostgreSQL, or Oracle).
* If you are planning on using the daemons handler:
  * An operating system and file system that supports file locking.
  * MRI ruby (aka "CRuby") as jRuby does not support `fork`. See the
    [FAQ](FAQ.md#im-using-jruby-how-can-i-use-the-daemon-handler) for possible workarounds.

### Installing under Rails

1. Add `workhorse` to your `Gemfile`:

   ```ruby
   gem 'workhorse'
   ```

   Install it using `bundle install` as usual.

2. Run the install generator:

   ```bash
   bundle exec rails generate workhorse:install
   ```

   This generates:

   * A database migration for creating a table named `jobs`
   * The initializer `config/initializers/workhorse.rb` for global configuration
   * The daemon worker script `bin/workhorse.rb`

   Please customize the initializer and worker script to your liking.

## Queuing jobs

### Basic jobs

Workhorse can handle any jobs that support the `perform` method and are
serializable. To queue a basic job, use the static method `Workhorse.enqueue`.
You can optionally pass a queue name and a priority.

```ruby
class MyJob
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def perform
    puts "Hello #{@name}"
  end
end

Workhorse.enqueue MyJob.new('John'), queue: :test, priority: 2
```

### RailsOps operations

Workhorse allows you to easily queue
[RailsOps](https://github.com/sitrox/rails_ops) operations using the static
method `Workhorse.enqueue_op`:

```ruby
Workhorse.enqueue_op Operations::Jobs::CleanUpDatabase, { queue: :maintenance, priority: 2 }, quiet: true
```

Params passed using the second argument will be used for operation instantiation
at job execution.

If you do not want to pass any params to the operation, just omit the second hash:

```ruby
Workhorse.enqueue_op Operations::Jobs::CleanUpDatabase, queue: :maintenance, priority: 2
```

### Scheduling

Workhorse has no out-of-the-box functionality to support scheduling of regular
jobs, such as maintenance or backup jobs. There are two primary ways of
achieving regular execution:

1. Rescheduling by the same job after successful execution and setting
   `perform_at`

   This is simple to set up and requires no additional dependencies. However,
   the time taken to execute a job and the time delay caused by the polling
   interval cannot easily be factored into the calculation of the interval,
   leading to a slight shift in effective execution date. (This can be mitigated
   by scheduling the job before knowing whether the current run will succeed.
   Proceed down this path at your own peril!)

   *Example:* A job that takes 5 seconds to run and is set to reschedule itself
   after 10 minutes is started at 12:00 sharp. After one hour it will be set to
   execute at 13:00:30 at the earliest.

   In its most basic form, the `perform` method of a job would look as follows:

   ```ruby
   class MyJob
     def perform
       # Do all the work

       # Perform again after 10 minutes (600 seconds)
       Workhorse.enqueue MyJob.new, perform_at: Time.now + 600
     end
   end
   ```

2. Using an external scheduler

   A more elaborate setup requires an external scheduler, but which can still be
   called from Ruby. One such scheduler is
   [rufus-scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler). A small
   example of an adapted `bin/workhorse.rb` to accommodate for the additional
   cog in the mechanism is given below:

   ```ruby
   #!/usr/bin/env ruby

   require './config/environment'

   Workhorse::Daemon::ShellHandler.run do |daemon|
     # Start scheduler process
     daemon.worker 'Scheduler' do
       scheduler = Rufus::Scheduler.new

       scheduler.cron '0/10 * * * *' do
         Workhorse.enqueue Workhorse::Jobs::CleanupSucceededJobs.new
       end

       Signal.trap 'TERM' do
         scheduler.shutdown
       end

       scheduler.join
     end

     # Start 5 worker processes with 3 threads each
     5.times do
       daemon.worker do
         Workhorse::Worker.start_and_wait(pool_size: 3, polling_interval: 10, logger: Rails.logger)
       end
     end
   end
   ```

   This allows starting and stopping the daemon with the usual interface.
   Note that the scheduler is handled like a Workhorse worker, the consequence
   of which is that only one 'worker' should be started by the ShellHandler.
   Otherwise there would be multiple jobs scheduled at the same time.

   Please refer to the documentation on
   [rufus-scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler) (or the
   scheduler of your choice) for further options concerning the timing of the
   jobs.

## Configuring and starting workers

Workers poll the database for new jobs and execute them in one or more threads.
Typically, one worker is started per process. While you can start workers
manually, either in your main application process(es) or in a separate one,
workhorse also provides you with a convenient way of starting one or multiple
worker processes as daemons.

### Start workers manually

Workers are created by instantiating, configuring, and starting a new
`Workhorse::Worker` instance:

```ruby
Workhorse::Worker.start_and_wait(
  pool_size: 5,                           # Processes 5 jobs concurrently
  quiet:     false,                       # Logs to STDOUT
  logger:    Rails.logger                 # Logs to Rails log. You can also
                                          # provide any custom logger.
)
```

See [code documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/sitrox/workhorse/Workhorse%2FWorker:initialize)
for more information on the arguments. All arguments passed to `start_and_wait`
are passed to the initialize. All arguments passed to `start_and_wait` are
in turn passed to the initializer of `Workhorse::Worker`.

### Start workers using a daemon script

Using `Workhorse::Daemon::ShellHandler`, you can spawn one or multiple worker
processes automatically. This is useful for cases where you want the workers to
exist in separate processes as opposed to your main application process(es).

For this case, the workhorse install routine automatically creates the file
`bin/workhorse.rb`, which can be used to start one or more worker processes.

The script can be called as follows:

```bash
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec bin/workhorse.rb start|stop|kill|status|watch|restart|usage
```

#### Background and customization

Within the shell handler, you can instantiate, configure, and start a worker as
described under [Start workers manually](#start-workers-manually):

```ruby
Workhorse::Daemon::ShellHandler.run do |daemon|
  5.times do
    daemon.worker do
      # This will be run 5 times, each time in a separate process. Per process, it
      # will be able to process 3 jobs concurrently.
      Workhorse::Worker.start_and_wait(pool_size: 3, logger: Rails.logger)
    end
  end
end
```

### Instant repolling

Per default, each worker only polls in the given interval. This means that if
you schedule, for example, 50 jobs at once and have a polling interval of 1
minute with a queue size of 1, the poller would tackle the first job and then
wait for a whole minute until the next poll. This would mean that these 50 jobs
would take at least 50 minutes to be executed, even if they only take a few
seconds each.

This is where *instant repolling* comes into play: Using the worker option
`instant_repolling`, you can force the poller to automatically re-poll the
database whenever a job has been performed. It then goes back to the usual
polling interval.

This setting is recommended for all setups and may eventually be enabled by
default.

## Exception handling

Per default, exceptions occurring in a worker thread will only be visible in the
respective log file, usually `production.log`. If you'd like to perform specific
actions when an exception arises, set the global option `on_exception` to a
callback of your linking, e.g.:

```ruby
# config/initializers/workhorse.rb
Workhorse.setup do |config|
  config.on_exception = proc do |e|
    # Use gem 'exception_notification' for notifying about exceptions
    ExceptionNotifier.notify_exception(e)
  end
end
```

## Handling database jobs

Jobs stored in the database can be accessed via the ActiveRecord model
{Workhorse::DbJob}. This is the model representing a specific job database entry
and is not to be confused with the actual job class you're enqueueing.

### Obtaining database jobs

DbJobs are returned to you when enqueuing new jobs:

```ruby
db_job = Workhorse.enqueue(MyJob.new)
```

You can also obtain a job via its ID that you either get from a returned job
(see example above) or else by manually querying the database table:

```ruby
db_job = Workhorse::DbJob.find(42)
```

Note that database job objects reflect the job at the point in time when the
database job object has been instantiated. To make sure you're looking at the
latest job info, use the in-place `reload` method:

```ruby
db_job.reload
```

You can also retrieve a list of jobs in a specific state using one of the
following methods:

```ruby
DbJob.waiting
DbJob.locked
DbJob.started
DbJob.succeeded
DbJob.failed
```

### Resetting jobs

Jobs in a state other than `waiting` are either being processed or else already
in a final state such as `succeeded` and won't be performed again. Workhorse
provides an API method for resetting jobs in the following cases:

* A job has succeeded or failed (states `succeeded` and `failed`) and needs to
  re-run. In these cases, perform a non-forced reset:

  ```ruby
  db_job.reset!
  ```

  This is always safe to do, even with workers running.

* A job is stuck in state `locked` or `started` and the corresponding worker
  (check the database field `locked_by`) is not running anymore, i.e. due to a
  database connection loss or an unexpected worker crash. In these cases, the
  job will never be processed, and, if the job is in a queue, the entire queue is
  considered to be locked and no further jobs will be processed in this queue.

  In these cases, make sure the worker is stopped and perform a forced reset:

  ```ruby
  db_job.reset!(true)
  ```

Performing a reset will reset the job state to `waiting` and it will be
processed again. All meta fields will be reset as well. See inline documentation
of `Workhorse::DbJob#reset!` for more details.


## Using workhorse with Rails / ActiveJob

While workhorse can be used though its custom interface as documented above, it
is also fully integrated into Rails using `ActiveJob`. See [documentation of
ActiveJob](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html) for more
information on how to use it.

To use workhorse as your ActiveJob backend, set the `queue_adapter` to
`workhorse`, either using `config.active_job.queue_adapter` in your application
configuration or else using `self.queue_adapter` in a job class inheriting from
`ActiveJob`. See ActiveJob documentation for more details.
